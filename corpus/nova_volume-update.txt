# Command: nova help volume-update

nova CLI is deprecated and will be removed in a future release
usage: nova volume-update
                          [--delete-on-termination | --no-delete-on-termination]
                          <server> <src_volume> <dest_volume>

Update the attachment on the server. If dest_volume is the same as the
src_volume then the command migrates the data from the attached volume to the
specified available volume and swaps out the active attachment to the new
volume. Otherwise it only updates the parameters of the existing attachment.

Positional arguments:
  <server>                    Name or ID of server.
  <src_volume>                ID of the source (original) volume.
  <dest_volume>               ID of the destination volume.

Options:
  --delete-on-termination     Specify that the volume should be deleted when
                              the server is destroyed. (Supported by API

  --no-delete-on-termination  Specify that the volume should not be deleted
                              when the server is destroyed. (Supported by API
