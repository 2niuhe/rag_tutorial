# Command: nova help service-delete

nova CLI is deprecated and will be removed in a future release
usage: nova service-delete <id>

Delete the service by UUID ID. If deleting a nova-compute service, be sure to
stop the actual nova-compute process on the physical host before deleting the
service with this command. Failing to do so can lead to the running service
re-creating orphaned compute_nodes table records in the database. (Supported
by API versions '2.0' - '2.latest') [hint: use '--os-compute-api-version' flag
to show help message for proper version]

Positional arguments:
  <id>  ID of service as a UUID.
