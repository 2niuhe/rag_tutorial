# Command: nova help reboot

nova CLI is deprecated and will be removed in a future release
usage: nova reboot [--hard] [--poll] <server> [<server> ...]

Reboot a server.

Positional arguments:
  <server>  Name or ID of server(s).

Options:
  --hard    Perform a hard reboot (instead of a soft one). Note: Ironic does
            not currently support soft reboot; consequently, bare metal nodes
            will always do a hard reboot, regardless of the use of this
            option.
  --poll    Poll until reboot is complete.
