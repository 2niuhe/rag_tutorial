# Command: nova help get-password

nova CLI is deprecated and will be removed in a future release
usage: nova get-password <server> [<private-key>]

Get the admin password for a server. This operation calls the metadata service
to query metadata information and does not read password information from the
server itself.

Positional arguments:
  <server>       Name or ID of server.
  <private-key>  Private key (used locally to decrypt password) (Optional).
                 When specified, the command displays the clear (decrypted) VM
                 password. When not specified, the ciphered VM password is
                 displayed.
